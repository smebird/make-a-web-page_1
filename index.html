        <p class="Text1">
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.

        <P class="Text1">The web has four main components:</P>
          <ol class="Ordered1">
          <li><strong>You:</strong> You want to visit a web page</li>
          <li><strong>Your computer plus a Browser:</strong> Your browser makes a request via the internet</li>
          <li><strong>The internet:</strong> Sends an HTTP request to a server</li>
          <li><strong>Server:</strong> Locates appropriate HTML document and sends it back to your computer where your web browser interprets<br> the page and displays it on your computer screen</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title1">What is a web page?</h2>
        <p class="Text1">
          A web page is a document written in a language called HTML.  Web browsers read these documents, interpret and display them.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title1">What is HTML?</h2>
        <p class="Text1">
          <b>HTML</b> (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage) is the heart of the web.
        </p>
        <p class="Text1">HTML is made up of:</p>
        <ul class="Bullets1">
          <li> Text content (What you see)</li>
          <li>Markup (What the text looks like)</li>
          <li>References to other documents (eg: images, videos, etc...)</li>
          <li>Links to other pages</li>
      </ul>

    <div>
      <p class="Text1">Basic HTML vocabulary you should know:</p>
  
      <!-- This information comes from:
      http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200508/html_tags_vs_elements_vs_attributes/ . I am 
      copying-rewording the explanation from that web page-->
  
      <p class="Text1">
        <b>Element:</b> A structure in HTML that consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
        <b>Tags:</b> Tags mark the beginning and end of an Element.  They are made of a less-than
        symbol, followed by the Element's name, followed by a greater-than symbol.
        <b>Attributes and values:</b>  Attributes follow tags and point to a value. Examples are
        images and links to other web pages
      </p>
      <p class="Text1">
        <em> Elements can be either <em><b>inline</b></em> (effecting just the text enclosed by tags), or 
        <b>block</b>(block elements have an invisible box around them with height and 
        width that separates them from any other element).
        While most Elements have both an <em><b>opening</b></em> and <em><b>closing</b></em> tag,  
        some Elements use only one tag<br> and are referred to as <b>void.</b></em>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="Title1">A Couple Other Points to Remember:</h2>
  
        <h3 class="Subtitle1">Computers are stupid</h3>
          <p class="Text1">
            Why?  Because they interpret instruction literally.  If you use the wrong Element name in your opening tag or make a typo, a computer cannot "know" what you intended. A program will only work if the instructions are clear and the grammar correct.
         </p>
        <h3 class="Subtitle1">There Is Far Too Much to Remember</h3>
          <p class="Text1">
            Don't try to memorize every single fact.  Instead, concentrate on understanding how programming languages work, and rely on the internet to remind you of an Element's name or a particular structure.
         </p>

      <h2 class="Title2">Part 1: How Do Websites Work?</h2> 
        <h3 class="Subtitle2">VOCABULARY:</h3>
          <p class="Text2"><strong>HTML:</strong> A Language with syntax and rules that provides the structure of the web page</p>
          <p class="Text2"><strong>CSS: Provides</strong> the styles seen on the web page</p>
          <p class="Text2"><strong>Javascript:</strong> Allows actions/changes on the web page</p>
         <p class="Text2"><strong>DOM</strong> (Document Object model): The standard convention for interacting with HTML</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title2">Dig deep into code (in Chrome):</h2>
        <ol class="Ordered2">
          <li>Click on the symbol in the top right corner made of
          three lines (looks like a hamburger)</li>
          <li>Choose "More Tools" from the menu</li>
          <li>Choose "Developer Tools." A panel will open showing the structure of the web page you are on.  This is not the code, but how the browser interprets
          it.</li>
          <li>Click on the triangles to reveal hidden levels</li>
          <li>This is the Tree-like structure of HTML</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Text2">For two good articles about Tree-like Structure, check
        out the following Wikipedia pages:</p>
          <ul class="Bullets2">
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">Tree Structure</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">Tree (Data Structure)</a></li>
          </ul>  
        <p class="Text2">
          Once you know the language, you can look at any HTML code and understand a great deal about how it will look as a web page.  Likewise, you can view any web page and know what the underlying code looks like.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title2">Everything in HTML is a box:</h2>
        <ul class="Bullets2">
          <li>We organize code by determining the placement and size of the largest "boxes" first, and defining smaller and smaller boxes into those spaces.</li>
          <li>Every "box" is defined by the tag "div."</li>
          <li>"Divs" can be nestled endlessly within other "Divs."</li>

            <li>&lt;h1 class="article"&gt;</li>
          </ul>
        <p class="Text2">
          In this example, the word "class" is an attribute. It allows the user to add CSS style choices to every h1 element with the value "article."

    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3"> How CSS works</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">First you need to link the CSS to your HTML:</h3>
          <ol class="Ordered3">
            <li>Type &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</li>
            <li>Create &lt;head&gt; tabs</li>
            <li>Add a &lt;link&gt; tab inside the "head" tab (Sublime finishes tags when you type the first letter).</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3"> What is CSS?</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">CSS = "Cascading Style Sheets"</h3>
          <p class="Text3"><strong>Cascading </strong>refers to the process of moving from the most general property to the most specific property in your document.
         </p>
          <p class="Text3">The <strong>styles</strong> used in your project can be broken into separate CSS files or <strong>"sheets"</strong> to aid in organizing.
          </p>
          <p class="Text3">CSS properties, or rules, work in a hierarchy, much as laws function in a country:</p>
            <ol class="Ordered3">
              <li>Federal = Document wide rules: properties applied to the highest level &lt;div&gt; block</li>
              <li>State = Properties applied to sub &lt;div&gt; blocks</li>
              <li>Municipal = Properties applied to sub-sub &lt;div&gt; blocks</li>
              <li>Home = Properties applied to individual elements</li>
            </ol>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Cascading depends upon <em>INHERITANCE</em> :</h3>
          <p class="Text3">
            <em>INHERITANCE</em> means that a property assigned to an element will be applied to all its descendents (children), unless<br> overwritten by a more local property.
          </p>
          <p class="Text3">
            Not all propterties are heritable. Refer to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" class="reference">CSS reference</a> to find out whether a property is, or is not.
          </p>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">To add a style choice, we create a <em>SELECTOR</em>:</h3>
          <p class="Text3">
            The <em>SELECTOR</em> we choose will determine to which elements a particular style is applied.
          </p>
          <p class="Text3">
            To see a list of available selectors, and the correct syntax for each, please refer to the <br><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" class="reference">CSS reference</a>

        </p>
    
    
        <h3 class="Subtitle3" >Remember!</h3>
          <ol class="Ordered3" >
            <li>
              Changing the visual properties of an element only changes how it is displayed, not what kind of element it is.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose type of element (tag) depending on what the element's purpose is.  That is, use a tag that matches function!
            </li>
            <li>When a tag changes, the box and the font can change as well</li>
         </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3">Understanding the Box Model</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">HTML boxes contain the following:</h3>
          <ol class="Ordered3">
            <li>Margin</li>
            <li>Border</li>
            <li>Padding</li>
            <li>Content</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="Text3">You can see an element's box in Dev Tools by clicking the Computed tab</p>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">
          At the center of this box is the <strong>Content</strong>.
        </h3>
          <ul class="Bullets3">
            <li>The image or text that appears on the website</li>
            <li>
          Consider the content the nucleus: It sits at the center and the surrouding layers protect it, so that other items don't overlap it or sit too close, making the website visually unappealing.
            </li>
          </ul>
      
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Next is the <strong>Padding</strong>.</h3>
          <ul class="Bullets3">
            <li>The Padding clears the area around the Content.</li>
            <li>It is affected by the background-color of the box </li>
            <li>Think of it as the space inside the box that protects the Content directly.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Next is the <strong>Border</strong>.</h3>
          <ul class="Bullets3">
            <li>The Border goes around both the Padding and the Content</li>
            <li>It is inherited from the color property of the box. </li>
          </ul>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">
          Last, the out layer is the <strong>Margin</strong>.
        </h3>
          <ul class="Bullets3">
            <li>The Margin clears an area around the Border</li>
            <li>It has no background-color.  It is completely transparent. </li>
            <li>Think of it as the space between boxes </li>
          </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3">Calculating Box Size</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Default = Sum of Border, Padding and Content</h3>
          <p class="Text3">
          To make the calculation easier, we put the following code into our CSS file:
          </p>
            <ol class="Ordered3">
              <li>* { </li>
              <li>box-sizing: border-box;</li>
              <li> } </li>
            </ol>
          <p class="Text3">
           Now, the calculation of the box includes both the border and the padding, so that it's easier to make layouts.
          </p>
          <p class="Text3">
           You just set the width of the overall box, and no matter how you tweak the padding and border layers, the size of the box will always stay the same.
         </p>
          <p class="Text3">The CSS must include browser-specific prefixes:</p>
            <ul class="Bullets3">
              <li>-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;</li>
              <li>-moz-box-sizing: border-box; </li>
              <li>-ms-box-sizing: border-box </li>
              <li>box-sizing: border-box</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="Text3">
          You can set the size of your box layers in pixels or in percentages:
          </p>
            <ul class="Bullets3">
              <li>% changes the box as the screen size changes</li>
              <li>pixel sets the image to one size, regardless of device.  This can lead to a bad user experience</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="Text3">
            You can set max-width, so that an element can get smaller, but not larger than a set value.  Max-width won't change layout.
          </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3">Positioning Elements</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">This is a complicated concept</h3>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Let's look at one display property: flex.</h3>
          <p class="Text3">
            Flex allows you to layout a line and distribute space among items in a container, or div.
          </p>
          <p class="Text3">
            The tag "div" is set, by default, to use the entire width of a page 
          </p>
          <p class="Text3">
            Flex overrides this behavior to allow divs to appear next to each other.
          </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3">Dev Tools</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Developer Tools can help speed up projects</h3>
          <p class="Text3">
            By first testing changes in Dev Tools, you can easily see whether a particular change is advantageous.
          </p>
          <p class="Text3"> Use an-online code validator to locate code errors.</p>
          <p class="Text3">
            Once validated, you can place icons on your webpage as proof that your webpage complies with standards.
          </p>
        
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3">How to move from Mockup to Computer:</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Code, Test, Refine</h3>
          <p class="Text3">
            By first testing changes in Dev Tools, you can easily see whether a particular change is advantageous.
          </p>
            <ul class="Bullets3">
              <li>First get structure from a design by visually "boxifying" it</li>
              <li>Look for natural boxes </li>
              <li>Choose sizes for boxes and work out their positions on the screen </li>
              <li>Next, work on placing appropriate tags where they belong </li>
              <li>Look for repeating styles and semantic elements:</li>
            </ul>
              <ul class="NoBullets3">
                <li> 
                  Avoiding repeating style information will keep your code easier to read and to edit<br> -- and will make it less bulky.
                </li>
                  <br>
                <li>
                  For instance, if every single &lt;p&gt; element has the same padding, there is no need to copy the padding style into every new selector.  Each selector should contain only the information that changes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <ul class="Bullets3">
